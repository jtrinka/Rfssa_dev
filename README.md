This repository serves as a place to put current developments of the Rfssa R package where such developments might not have been fully tested yet and are not ready to be included in the Rfssa R package hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/haghbinh/Rfssa. The idea is that after the developments have undergone full testing, the extensions will be included in the official Rfssa R package hosted on GitHub and eventually, the package will be updated on CRAN.
